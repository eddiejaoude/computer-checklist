# Computer Checklist

From security to backups

## Firewall

- Builtin firewall as a minimum
- Even better use one that request access and has different rules for `home`, `work` and `public hotspot`
- Use a paid for [private VPN](http://privateinternetaccess.com) so no one can see your traffic especially if you use wifi that you dont control

## Backups

### Offline

- Timemachine - automatic incremental backup and includes file versions & deleted files (must use the encrypt option)

### Online

- Not dropbox or alternative
- Something like [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html) where you can create a private key and no one else has this so only you can unencrypt your files

## Encryption

- Computer disk encrption like **FileVault**

## Online accounts

- Must use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

## Devices (mic / camera)

- Cover these up when not in use

## Bonus points

- 2FA key like [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/?gclid=CLnx0LPE4tQCFUKx7Qod3FUJJw)
